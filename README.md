# Flash Cards Project

Flash Card Application built with Java. I created this to help me study for classes, specifically Chinese. I also created this to help me learn how to use JavaFx. The application is uses SQLite to store all the flash card data. 

The idea is that users create a "Flash Card Stack" which then you can add cards into that stack 

## Getting Started

### Installing 
The Mac dmg can be found in the "Mac_dmg" folder. You can double-click on the dmg and drag the application into your application folder 

### Creating/Deleting a new Flash Card Stack
You can create a new Flash Card Stack by clicking on 
```
File > Add New Flash Card Stack
```

You can delete the Stack by going to 
```
Edit > Delete Flash Card Stack
```
which then you can select which Stack you want to remove. Removing a Stack will remove all the Cards from the database.

## Future Plans
